INTRODUCTION 
 
The task of stock price prediction has long been a topic of interest among investors and researchers. With the advent of machine learning and data analysis tools, predicting stock movements has become more accessible. However, stock market predictions are inherently challenging due to their volatile and dynamic nature. 
This document introduces a Rule-Based Stock Price Prediction Algorithm that uses historical stock price data to generate buy or sell signals based on technical indicators. The approach focuses on the use of Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a widely known and effective tool in technical analysis, to predict the movement of stock prices. The algorithm is designed to analyze historical stock data and generate predictions based on the following rules: 
•	Buy Signal: When the short-term moving average (50-day SMA) is above the long-term moving average (200-day SMA) and the price change for the day is positive (the stock price increased). 
•	Sell Signal: When the short-term moving average (50-day SMA) is below the long-term moving average (200-day SMA) and the price change for the day is negative (the stock price decreased). 
•	No Action: When the stock price movement does not meet the conditions for a buy or sell signal. 
The program utilizes Python, specifically the pandas library, to read historical stock data from a CSV file, calculate relevant technical indicators, and apply the rule-based prediction system. The results are then visualized using matplotlib to provide an easy-to-understand representation of stock price movements and the algorithm's predictions. 
This method offers a straightforward and interpretable approach to stock price prediction, making it an ideal starting point for those looking to explore stock market analysis using rule-based techniques. However, it is important to note that this method relies purely on historical data and does not consider external factors, news, or market sentiment, which may have a significant impact on stock prices.
